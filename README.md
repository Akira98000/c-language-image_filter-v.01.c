## What is bmp and how the filtering is working ? 
A BMP (bitmap) image is a widely-used raster graphics image format for storing digital images. BMP images are comprised of pixels arranged in a rectangular grid, with each pixel representing a specific color or shade. They are supported by most image editing software and are commonly used on Microsoft Windows operating systems.

Image filtering is a process of enhancing or modifying an image using various algorithms and techniques. Image filters can be used to adjust brightness or contrast, blur or sharpen an image, remove noise or distortions, or apply various effects such as sepia, grayscale, or hue shift.

In the context of BMP images, filtering involves applying mathematical operations to the pixel data in the image. These operations can be applied in a variety of ways, including convolution, edge detection, or color space transformation. The output is a new image that has been modified according to the filtering algorithm.

Overall, image filtering is an essential technique used in digital image processing to improve the quality and appearance of images.
